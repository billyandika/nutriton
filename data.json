			"content": "With one cup of quinoa, you get about twenty times the amount of magnesium, potassium, and iron, nearly forty times the amount of folate, and double the protein found in one cup of white rice. No wonder it's in high demand. That being said, the best places to buy quinoa are wholesale clubs, and online. Natural food stores will offer quinoa in bulk, which will save you more money. You may also want to buy quinoa through local stores such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe's.",
