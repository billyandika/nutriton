		"content": "With one cup of quinoa, you get about twenty times the amount of magnesium, potassium, and iron, nearly forty times the amount of folate, and double the protein found in one cup of white rice. No wonder it's in high demand. That being said, the best places to buy quinoa are wholesale clubs, and online. Natural food stores will offer quinoa in bulk, which will save you more money. You may also want to buy quinoa through local stores such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe's.",

		"title": "Gluten-Free Food at UCSD's Earls Market",
		"content": "UCSD is considered one of the most vegan-friendly college campus. But how gluten-free-friendly are the markets? Most students who have a gluten-free diet often have to buy extra ingredients from off-campus, and that could end up costing more than what one would normally spend on groceries. Visiting UCSD's Earl's Market, there were several items labeled gluten-free: STRONG gluten-free protein bars, wheat-free gluten-free spaghetti, Annie's gluten-free rice pasta and cheddar macaroni and cheese, thepurepantry gluten-free pancake and baking mix, and glutino's variety of gluten-free breakfast foods. Sadly there were no gluten-free candy bars. I guess I'll check the other markets.",
